# Crime-rate-prediction-and-safety-navigation-using-google-maps
Developed a system that predicts crime rates in different areas and provides safe navigation routes using Google Maps 
API. 
• Integrated machine learning models to analyze historical crime data and predict crime trends for specific locations. 
• Designed a real-time navigation feature that suggests the safest routes based on current crime statistics. 
• Tools: Python, Google Maps API, Machine Learning. 
• Outcome: Enhanced route safety by suggesting alternative paths in areas with higher predicted crime rates.
